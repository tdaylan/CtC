# general guidelines

# Please, let's try to

## write comments at the top of reasonably-sized chuncks of your code

## commit your work frequently
    ### allows faster communication among contributors to the code
    ### reduces the chances of losing work in the local repository

## maintain the namespace conventions

## add a comment that starts with '# temp -- ', when you are making a temporary change to the code, or hacking it just to try something for a moment. This makes it easy to notice or search hacky, temporary or extraordinary changes to the repository.

## avoid uncommented parameter values in arbitrary locations in the code. Try to define parameter values together at the top your code and comment them.

## not repeat code. If you need to do the same operation in multiple points, make your code a function and call it multiple times.

## maintain separate branches for major tasks, which will then be merged into the master branch
