# Guidelines for contributing to the repository. Please, let's try to:
## write comments at the top of reasonably-sized chuncks of your code
## commit your work frequently
    ### allows faster communication among contributors to the code
    ### reduces the chances of losing work in the local repository
## maintain the namespace conventions
## add a comment that starts with '# temp -- ', when you are making a temporary change to the code, or hacking it just to try something for a moment. This makes it easy to notice or search hacky, temporary or extraordinary changes to the repository.
## avoid uncommented parameter values in arbitrary locations in the code. Try to define parameter values together at the top your code and comment them.
## not repeat code. If you need to do the same operation in multiple points, make your code a function and call it multiple times.
## maintain separate branches for major tasks, which will then be merged into the master branch

# to-do-list
## implement a simple 1D CNN on 
## implement a 2 channel 1D CNN with FC layers
## get Kepler data from MAST
## Ensure the above nets perform well
## Channel off to individual projects

# diagnostic actions to take when the solution is not working
## data augmentation -- increase the number of (signal) training data samples by drawing from a previously trained generative model
## add batch normalization after FC or pool layers

# diagnostic plots to produce
## animation showing samples from the training data samples
## a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) of your neural network
## 2D projection of the feature space representation of the training data samples (e.g. via t-SNE)
## AUC, i.e., recall vs precision for a grid of classification thresholds
